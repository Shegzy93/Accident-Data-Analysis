# Accident-Data-Analysis

Summary of the "Accident Data"

Objective:

- Analyze UK road accident data to improve road safety by identifying patterns and trends in accidents.

Techniques:

- Utilized association rule mining, classification models, and clustering algorithms.

Key Findings:

1. Accident Trends:

- Days: Highest accident rates on Fridays.

- Hours: Peaks at 17:00 (rush hour) and 7:00-8:00 (morning commute).

2. Motorbike Accidents:

- Most frequent on Fridays, particularly for motorcycles 125cc and under.

3. Pedestrian Accidents:

- Peak at 15:00, aligning with school dismissal times.

4. Association Rules: Apriori algorithm identified patterns in accident severity based on factors like weather and road type.

5. Geographical Clustering:

- K-Means and K-Medoids: Clustering highlighted Hull as an accident hotspot.

6. Data Cleaning and Outlier Detection: Applied one-hot encoding, corrected erroneous entries, and used Isolation Forest for anomaly detection.

7. Predictive Modeling: Decision tree classifier and stacking classifiers used to predict accident severity.

Recommendations:

- Monitor and manage traffic during peak hours.

- Target safety campaigns towards motorcyclists.

- Implement educational programs for school children on road safety.

- Improve infrastructure in identified high-accident areas.

- Continuously collect and analyze data for adaptive safety measures.
